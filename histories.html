		<p><center>Histories are a container for your data and the ways you have worked with it. They can be searched, copied, deleted, and purged permanently. Similarly,
		all of those actions can also be performed on the individual items within those Histories. This tutorial documents various ways you can make Histories work for you.</center></p>

		<div class="collapsible-content" id="operation">
			<p>It is helpful to keep separate GalaxyTrakr histories for separate data. 
				Your current GalaxyTrakr history is visible in the pane on the right. All your histories can be accessed from the Histories and History Multiview tiles on the left.</p>
			<p>Create a new history by clicking the '+' near the top of the current history pane at the right. You will automatically switch to the new Unnamed history. Rename using the pencil icon and save changes.
				You can also add tags and annotations from the editing menu.
			</p>
			<p>Access shared histories in the Histories tile at the left. The Public Histories tab shows published histories from other users, which can be viewed after clicking the history name and then imported.</p>
			<p>To share your own histories, use either the Share and Publish option on the dropdown menu for the history in the Histories tile or the Share and Manage Access option from the menu of your current history. 
				To share a history with individual GalaxyTrakr users, list the email address associated with their GalaxyTrakr account, hit Enter, and select Save. Or choose to Make History Accessible, which will generate a 
				link. Any GalaxyTrakr user with this link can access your accessible history. To make your history available as a Public History, select to make your history publicly available. 
			</p>
			<p>If you have finished with a history, you can Archive a history that you want to keep, but not edit, from the current history menu at the top right. You can find Archived histories in the Archived Histories tab of the Histories tile. 
				Archived histories can be Unarchived from this Archived Histories page.
			</p>
			<p>If you are completely finished with a history, it can be Deleted or Permanently Deleted.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deleting a history moves the history and all its contents to a "deleted" state, but it can be recovered</li>
				<li>Permanently Deleting a history, also known as Purging a history, will remove the history and all its contents forever</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Delete or Permanently Delete histories from either the current history menu, choosing Delete and then confirming the deletion, or from the dropdown menu under each history in the Histories tile.
				Multiple histories can be Deleted or Purged at once using the checkboxes in the Histories tile to select multiple histories at once.
